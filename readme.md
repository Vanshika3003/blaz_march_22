# JavaScript Full Stack

- Fundamental JS Programming
    - JS Requirements
        - Foundation of Modern Open JS Full Stack App development
        - Provides End-to-End support for Application development
            - Interactive Front-End with Browser
            - Server-Side Apps
    - Types
        - No explicit DataTypes
        - a Variable is declared using 'var' keyword
            - The 'var' provides a function scope for a variable
        - The Type is parsed by JS Parser which is already available in browser 
            - Parsed Types as 
                - number, string, boolean,  object, function

            - document
                - Currently loaded HTML DOM in current window object
                - to extract the DOM elements using 'document' object, use the window.onload event

                                - type: the type of UI that will be shown on browser
                                - value: the data that can be entered in textbox and can be read from textbox
                                - id: the Unique identity of UI element in DOM

                    - The 'document' object's methods to extract UI element from DOM
                        - getElementById('id'); return an instance of single HTML element
                        - getElementsByTagName('TAG-NAME'), returns collection of HTML elements having name property value
                            - e.g. 
                                - document.getElementsByTagName('input'), return collection of input elements
                        - getElementsByClass('class-name'), returns collection of HTML elements having same class name property value        
                        - addEventListener(p1,p2,p3);
                            - USed to attach an event with UI element
                            - p1: the event name, e.g. click, change, blur, mouseenter, mouseleave, keyup, etc.
                            - p2: the function that will be executed when an event is raised

            - Array (Not Directly accessible, but available as type)
                - The only Standard Collection Data Structure in JS

                    - console.error()
